### Abstract

We utilize in-situ total scattering to probe catalyst structures during catalysis, focusing on methanation optimization through hydrogen fluctuation studies. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and mass spectrometry (MS) are integrated for real-time monitoring of particle growth, structural changes, and activity. High-energy X-ray scattering with 2D detectors provides sub-second resolution, simulating real-world-like conditions. Our 6-hour study, combining catalysis and drop-out cycles, unveils dynamic structural shifts at 100 ms resolution. Notably, prolonged hydrogen absence induces distinct lattice parameter changes, impacting catalyst structure and performance. These findings offer vital insights for catalyst design under transient and extended conditions.
